### Hi there 👋

Here you can see the many interesting things I do in my free time.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go, C, C++, Cloud Native
- 🛠️ I'm used to using Java, Go, Python, NodeJS, Vue, Docker and in both backend and frontend development.
- 🕰 I'm also try to use C, C++, Rust and Dart (for Flutter) at other times
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the development of [Steam Original Soundtrack Player](https://github.com/skye-z/steam-ost-player).
- 💬 Ask me about Java, Go, NodeJS, Cloud Native, Docker
- 📫 The best way to reach me is sending me an email

Outside of Github, I work in the medical industry and enjoy pure music and single player games.
